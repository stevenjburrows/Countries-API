# Make an app with the Countries API

## Objectives

Using vanilla JavaScript the app can 
- Display the total population of all the countries the API provides.
- Allow the user to select a single country and display information about it (at least the country's name and flag).
- Allow users to add their favourite countries to a list that is also displayed in your app.
